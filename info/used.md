**How it is used:**

Anagramming can be a fun way to train your brain, but they have other applications.
Psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called "anagram solution tasks", to assess the implicit memory.
Anagrams are often used to create pseudonyms, allowing one to conceal, reveal or operate somewhere in between - 
like a mask that can establish identity.
In addition to this, multiple anagramming is a technique sometimes used to solve some kinds of cryptograms.
