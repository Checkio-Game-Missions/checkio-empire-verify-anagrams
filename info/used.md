**How it is used:**

Anagramming can be a fun way to train your brain, but they have and another application.
Psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called "anagram solution tasks", to assess the implicit memory.
Anagrams are connected to pseudonyms, by the fact that they may conceal or reveal,
or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity.
In addition to this, multiple anagramming is a technique sometimes used to solve some kinds of cryptograms.
